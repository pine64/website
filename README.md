## Building the website

Install `git` and check out the website repository using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pine64/website.git
cd website-main
```

### Get Hugo

Install *Hugo* as explained under https://gohugo.io/installation/.

* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S hugo`
* Debian: `sudo apt install hugo`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install hugo`
* Gentoo: `sudo emerge --ask www-apps/hugo` (SASS/SCSS support not required)
* NixOS: `nix-shell -p hugo` (to temporarily test it in a nix-shell)
* openSUSE: `sudo zypper install hugo`
* Solus: `sudo eopkg install hugo`
* Windows: See [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/)
* MacOS: See [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/)

### Preview the website

The website can be previewed with Hugo using an in-built webserver for development purposes. Hugo will also watch for file changes and automatically rebuild the site and reload the page in your browser. To preview the website, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:1313/]()

### Generate the html pages (optional)

```bash
hugo
```
