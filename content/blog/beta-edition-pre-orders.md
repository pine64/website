I am pleased to announce that pre-orders for the PinePhone BETA Edition will **open on March 24**. The PinePhone BETA Edition is powered by **[KDE Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/)** and **[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)**.

To learn more about the BETA Edition please read the [March Community Update](https://www.pine64.org/2021/03/15/march-update/). 

PinePhone BETA Edition will be made available in two hardware configurations:

- **$149 — 2GB RAM; 16GB eMMC**
