Welcome to our long-awaited community post, where we aim to address the most commonly asked question while also unveiling some more news. Let’s get started!

## Why hasn’t there been a community update for the past few months? Is PINE64 dead?

As you may have noticed, there haven’t been any community updates as of late, and we are sorry for the prolonged silence.
This isn’t because the community hasn’t been busy, quite the opposite is true.
Instead, the problem is that the usual community update authors are too busy with their daily jobs and other tasks around the community.
Although thanks to some community members who have shown interest to participate, we are working on a new community update and we hope we will publish it soon!

## Pine Store now accepts payments in cryptocurrency.

The community has consistently expressed interest in paying on the Pine Store with cryptocurrency, and despite several previous attempts to find a suitable crypto payment service, the process has proven challenging, leading to eventual failure. However, we are happy to announce that Pine Store now facilitates payments using USD Coin cryptocurrency via Coinbase!

## Talk to us at our upcoming community meetup in Warsaw!

We always attempt to meet in person at least twice a year. For reasons that ought to be obvious to everyone, this wasn’t possible these past few years, but now that travel is once again viable we’re returning to a bi-annual meetup schedule. We always meet at FOSDEM in February followed by a meeting halfway through the calendar year. While FOSDEM primarily serves the function of interacting with the broader Linux community and members of other projects as well as product announcements, the second yearly meetup aims at evaluating the project’s progress, identifying issues, and creating a roadmap for the coming months. This year we’re holding the second meetup in Warsaw. TL, Ayufan, Lukasz, and I will be having lunch in Hala Gwardii on Sunday, August 20th at noon. The place offers a wide variety of foods from around the world and is a short walk from Ratusz Arsenał metro station. You can also reach the place easily from every corner of Warsaw via all the public transport the city has to offer. So if you’re in Warsaw or can travel to see us on this date, then consider yourself invited. We’ll be keeping an eye on the #offtopic chat on the 19th so let us know when you’ve arrived and one of us will let you know where we’re sitting. Looking forward to seeing you there!

That’s all for this quick update about what is going on. I hope that we will see you soon on the next community update!

(Big thanks to CounterPillow, Funeral, Lukasz, JF002, Ralimtek, CarbonatedCaffeine, and MPReDiToR for help with this and future updates!)
