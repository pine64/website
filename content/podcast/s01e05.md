In the fifth episode of PineTalk, Ezra and Peter discuss a few aspects of the latest Community Update, PineCube news, the component shortage and answer a few of your questions. BTW: Keep getting them in!

## What have we been up to lately?

* Ezra recently finished working on the codebase of a project: It’s a fan game, written in C from the engine to the game.
* Peter has re-installed his laptop with pre-release Fedora 34 Workstation and have been enjoying GNOME 40 since. Also, the [LINMOBapps Game list](https://linmobapps.frama.io/games.html) is maintained again, thanks to Moxvallix for taking it on!
