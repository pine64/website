_When are we going to hear/see more about the PineCube?_

Sadly no, but Ezra commits to reporting about his successes and failures in the next episode!

Content to read on the topic: [Protecting Linux devices with verified boot, from ROM to Userspace](http://linuxgizmos.com/protecting-linux-devices-with-verified-boot-from-rom-to-userspace/).

If you have experimented with this on the PinePhone, please get in touch!

#### iNTRa asked on YouTube

_Do either of you have your own channels that you post on?_

Ezra writes on [Elatronion.com](https://elatronion.com/), and publishes videos on [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@Elatronion:a) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLN0SPhQo4jAPpTFNsxUnMg).

_How about a FM radio back cover?_

Apologies for saying I-two-C, it’s I-square-C. We don’t really know beyond this: RTP’s [SDR Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffEGdbXt2Qo)
