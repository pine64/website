== Quartz64 Zero

The Quartz64 Zero SBC is featuring the Rockchip RK3566T SoC in a smaller PCB form factor. This SoC combines a quad-core, ARM Cortex-A55 1.6GHz CPU with a Mali-G52-2EE GPU. It is capable of driving a single 4K display at 60fps and the GPU uses the open source Panfrost driver. It also has the benefit of running very cool, even without a heatsink and under a sustained load. This SBC is equipped with 1GB LPDDR4 system memory, an optional eMMC module (up to 128GB) and microSD slot for booting. The board is equipped with a Wifi/BT with flex antenna, a custom PCIe connector, an USB 3.0 type A host port, as well as many other peripheral device interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, for makers to integrate with sensors and other peripherals.

The Quartz64 Zero is a low cost board suitable for various commercial project application and guarantee supply at least until year 2028. Commercial order can customize the Quartz64 Zero board (without PCB change request) per their requirement (such as different DRAM Capacity, on-board eMMC, staff Ethernet Port) and MoQ:2000 apply.

Note: Power Adapter requirement: 5V 3A type H 3.5mm OD/1.35mm ID barrel type DC Jack Power Supply
