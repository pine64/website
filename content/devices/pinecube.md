## Who is Looking at You? The CUBE is an Open Source IP Cam Under Your Control

The CUBE is a small, low-powered, open source IP camera. Whether you’re a parent looking for a FOSS baby-camera, a privacy oriented shop keeper, home owner looking for a security camera, or perhaps a tinkerer needing a camera for your drone – the CUBE can be the device for you. Featuring an 5MPx Omnivision sensor and IR LEDs for night vision, as well as Power Over Ethernet, and a microphone, the use-cases for this little camera are limitless.

Being a FOSS device means that the CUBE remains under your, and only your, control at all times. This is a rather important factor for a device that has a camera and a microphone installed, wouldn’t you say?
