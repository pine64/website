== A Powerful AI Compute Module

The SOEDGE is a 3TOPS compute module that can be paired with a dedicated baseboard or the SOEDGE Baseboard for development. It can also be connected to a SBC, such as the ROCKPro64, or a regular X86 PC using PCIe or USB 3.0 using special adapters. The SOEDGE is, at the time of writing, in early stages of development; if you are a developer interested in Neural Networks and open hardware, please contact us directly for a development unit.
