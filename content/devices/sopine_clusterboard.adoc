== SOPINE Clusterboard

The Clusterboard is a gateway into the world of clusters in a tidy and compact package. The SOPINE Custerboard can host up-to 7 SOPINE modules. The Clusterboard can be powered either using a +5V 15A power supply with 6.3mm OD/3.0mm ID barrel type DC Jack or an ATX power supply*. Each of the SOPINE cluster nodes is able to interface with the entire system via the onboard Ethernet switch. Each node has a USB 2.0 host port and  20 GPIO pins exposed.

*please note that some ATX power supplies may required load to power up the board
