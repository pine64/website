## A Small Form-Factor Single Board Computer Capable of 4K playback

ROCK64 is a credit card sized Single Board Computer powered by Rockchip RK3328 quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor and support up to 4GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory. It provides an eMMC module socket, MicroSD Card slot, Pi-2 bus, Pi-P5+ bus, USB 3.0 and many others peripheral devices interface for makers to integrate with sensors and devices.

Various operating systems are made available by open source community and partner projects including numerous Linux Distributions, Android, *BSD and more.

The ROCK64 4GB board is designated as LTS (Long Term Supply), which means that PINE64 is committed to supply it for at least 5 years – up until 2022 and possibly beyond.
