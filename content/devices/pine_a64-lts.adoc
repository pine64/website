== The Long Term Supply Version of the PINE A64 (+)

The PINE64-LTS is the Long Term Supply version of the PINE A64 (+), our first Single Board Computer, powered by Allwinner’s A64 quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit SoC. There are many Operating Systems available for the PINE A64-LTS created by the open source community and various partner projects. Currently the majority of Linux distributions for the PINE A64-LTS are using mainline Linux but there are a number of BSP-based distribution and / or legacy systems that you can download too.

Apart from Linux, you also have a choice of a selection of *BSD and Android. The PINE A64-LTS is guaranteed to be supplied for 5 years until year 2022 at the very least.
