{{< admonition type="info" >}}

PINE64 community is not some always responding, restless commercial customer service, or some sort of almighty existence that can resolve all your problems. When participating in community discussions, please be patient and do not expect questions to be answered immediately, certainly, or currently.

* The activity of community members varies depending on the time of day and the number of active users.
* Whether your questions will be answered & whether the answers are right and definitive, depends on the information you provide, and, after all, difficulty of your questions & community members' ability.
* Read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) to learn more.
* PINE64 uses a bridge bot (_[matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge)_ with some modifications), which allows Discord, IRC, Matrix, and Telegram users to see and participate in the community chat.
* The bot name is "Pine64 Protocol Droid" and if you see this, look in the message to see the actual author of the message.
* When the bot relays messages it will show the platform the user is using: _[D]_ for _Discord_, _[I]_ for _IRC_, _[M]_ for _Matrix_ and _[T]_ for _Telegram_.
