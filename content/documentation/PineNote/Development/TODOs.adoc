== Kernel/driver TODOs
These exist, but they haven't been written down yet.

== Userspace TODOs

The TODOs in this space are organized around what functionality they enable. A table of the important functions that a user may want in the PineNote and a status are listed below:

|===
| Functionality | Approaches (apps) | Level of support (subjective) | Supports | Does not yet support | Notes

.2+| Reading Documents
| `https://github.com/koreader/koreader[Koreader]`
| Great
| Fully featured ebook reader; Supports many filetypes;
| Handwritten notes
| Large user base on many devices; codebase has a somewhat of a reputation for being messy

| `https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp[Xournalpp]`
| Good
| Reading/writing PDFs and other files;
| No definition support (long-press for definition)
| Billed more as a note-taking app than a document reading app
|===

=== Themes

A lot of getting the PineNote to work nicely will be theming things appropriately. Please list themes for various components here:

==== GNOME

Untested: https://github.com/fujimo-t/gnome-shell-theme-e-ink

==== GTK

TODO

=== GNOME Configurations

See link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Apps#Gnome[here].

=== Sway Configurations

See link:/documentation/wiki/PineNote/Development/Apps#Sway[here].

== Documentation TODOs

* Pin Mesa Packages so they don't update when we upgrade other packages
** Add the information near step 5 link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Building_Kernel#Steps_to_build[here].
* Control the backlight
* Building alacritty correctly
* Force a screen refresh?
** See conversation here: https://matrix.to/#/!QtTzSRYMuozjbOQkzJ:matrix.org/$tfumBpnP2UPouNpaeFrggR40ZkrD_pHAtJdQmQvzL-o?via=matrix.org&via=kde.org&via=tchncs.de
