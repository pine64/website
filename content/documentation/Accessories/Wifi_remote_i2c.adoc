== Quick Start Guide

=== Hardware Setup
image:/documentation/images/PMWF01A_Wifi_Remote_IO_Rev3-1.jpg[Hardware Setup,title="Hardware Setup"]

* Make sure that the driver for USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) is properly install and the PC is detected it as Comm Port.
* The USB/UART Bridge is base on http://www.silabs.com/products/interface/usb-bridges/classic-usb-bridges/Pages/usb-to-uart-bridge.aspx[Silicon Lab CP2012 chipset].
* USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) driver can be https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx[Download here]
* Connect the USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) to the Wifi Remote I2c Device.
* You can power-up the WiFI Remote I2c module through the USB Bus for configuration and programming.

Place the jumper J2 on USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) to 5V output selection.

=== Setting Configuration

image:/documentation/images/Wr_cfghelp_scr.JPG[Help Command,title="Help Command"]

* For windows system, you can use terminal emulator program Termite to configure the device.
* Termite can be downloaded at http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm[CompuPhase Website ]
* Make sure the 'Port' setting is refer to the USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01)'s Virtual Comm Port.
* Follow the setting according to the setup screen capture. (57600Baud 8-N-1)
* Once Termite configuration is done, press 'OK' to save the setting.
* On the Wifi Remote I2c Device, Press the configuration button to allow the device to go into configuration mode.
image:/documentation/images/Wr_Config_Mode_Sw.jpg[]
Press Config Mode button to go into configuration mode

* Type 'help' to show the command available for configuration.
* Type 'show' to list out current configuration.
* We will use PineA64 as our Wifi Remote I2c module's server.
* To Set the PineA64's IP address in to the device, enter (we will be using IP address 192.168.0.230 as example)
   server 192.168.0.230
* To configure the Wifi AP SSID and Password, (eg SSID=TestingWifi and Password=12345 )
   wifi TestingWifi 12345
* The SSID and password are case sensitive. Please make sure it is input correctly.
* Once configuration is done, type 'exit' to exit configuration mode and allow the device to reboot.
* Please make sure your network is has DHCP server. The WiFi Remote i2c module will be running on DHCP mode and will requesting a IP address from your network's DHCP server.
* After reboot, the Red LED indicator will start to blink in fast blinking mode.
* Once the WiFi Remote I2c module connected to the WiFi Access Point, the LED indicator will go into slow blinking mode.
* The hardware configuration is done.
* The next step will be configure the PineWifiServer into your PineA64 board.

=== Setup the PineWifiServer

* link:/documentation/Unsorted/Wifi_remote_i2c#download[Download the PineWifiServer from the Download Section]
* Copy PineWifiServer xxxxxxxx.gz  into your PineA64 with linux on it. (where xxxxxxxx is the version number)
* Unzip the file using gunzip.
* Add Execution flag on both of the file by
  chmod +x PineWifiServer
* Start the PineWifiServer by
  ./PineWifiServer
* Once the server is started, you will notice that the LED indicator on the Wifi Remote I2c Hardware will change from slow blinking to always on.
* To login into the server, telnet into localhost port 10000
  telnet localhost 10000

image:/documentation/images/Wr_putty_login.JPG[PineWifiServer Login Screen,title="PineWifiServer Login Screen"]

* To show current connect Wifi Remote I2c type 'list' in small capital letter.
* To see all available command, type 'help'.
* To exit the console, type 'exit'.
* Please take note that you are only allow one login simultaneously. The second telnet login will be rejected.

=== Running the WifiAppDemo

* link:/documentation/Unsorted/Wifi_remote_i2c#download[Download the PineWifiServer from the Download Section]
* Copy WifiAppDemo xxxxxxxx.gz into your same PineA64 board that currently running with PineWifiServer. (where xxxxxxxx is the version number)
* Unzip both of the file using gunzip.
* Add Execution flag on both of the file by
  chmod +x WifiAppDemo
* before start running the demo application, please logout any telnet session to the PineWifiServer.
* The demo application will telnet into the PineWifiServer and start polling all the available Wifi Remote I2c device currently connected to the server.
* The demo application will also poll the I2c port of the hardware for the Ambient Light Sensor and the Temperature/Humidity Sensor if the sensor is connected to the Wifi Remote I2c module.
* To start the WifiAppDemo, type
  ./WifiAppDemo
* The Application will connect the PineWifiServer currently running in the localhost.

== Firmware Upgrade

=== Hardware Setup
image:/documentation/images/Wr_Programming_Mode_Jumper.jpg[width=100]

Short Jumper S2 on the WiFI Remote I2c module (before power up the board) to allow the board to go in to firmware programming mode.

image:/documentation/images/PMWF01A_Wifi_Remote_IO_Rev3-1.jpg[Hardware Setup,title="Hardware Setup"]

* Make sure that the driver for USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) is properly install and the PC is detected it as Comm Port.
* The USB/UART Bridge is base on http://www.silabs.com/products/interface/usb-bridges/classic-usb-bridges/Pages/usb-to-uart-bridge.aspx[Silicon Lab CP2012 chipset].
* USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) driver can be https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx[Download here]
* Connect the USB/UART Programming/Console Adapter (PMPROG01) to the Wifi Remote I2c Device.
* You can power-up the WiFI Remote I2c module through the USB Bus for configuration and programming.
