A 120W desktop power adapter. It features 1 USB-C port and 4 USB-A port. The 120W output is not per port, but total output power. This is calculated by combining the 65W USB-C, 3x15W USB-A and the 18W USB-A QC, making a total of 128W. The only difference between the US and EU edition is the supplied power cable. Every port, with exception of the wireless Q-charger, has a display, portraying the output voltage and amps. The display back light can be turned on and off by capacitive touch button, located on the top left side of the unit.

== Internals

The power unit is not made to be disassembled, do so at your own risk. The front plate is secured with 4 tabs, that can be disengaged with a screwdriver. The complete assembly can be slid out, but do mind the same tab in the casing. The power button at the back of the case has a plug that can be disconnected from the main PCB. The wireless charging PCB has to be de-soldered, or forcefully removed from the inner casing, as it is glued to the top of the case.

Some remarks:

* This main PCB is marked as XR SEMI v1.1
* Two unmarked packages, control the display.
* An antenna is connected on the display PCB, lining up with the 'lamp' symbol. This is the capacitive touch button to control the display back light.
* The 65W PD USB-C port is controlled by a http://www.hynetek.com/product/pdController/HUSB339/document/HUSB339_DS_EN_V1.2.pdf[HUSB339] controller, paired with a GOFORD G16 MOSFET.
* The other ports have a http://www.lshchip.com/pdf/Deep-pool/NDP1360KC_EN_Rev1.1.pdf[NDP1360KC] as final power converter.
