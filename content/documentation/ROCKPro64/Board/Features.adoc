| Feature/Option | Android | Android Version | Linux | Linux Version | Test/Verify Steps | Notes | Product Link

| PINE64 LCD Touchscreen (Screen/Touch)
| Yes/Yes
|
| No/No
|
|
| Maybe https://github.com/avafinger/pine64-touchscreen[this] will help get this working?

| Wireless
ROCKPro64 2×2 MIMO Dual Band WiFi 802.11AC / Bluetooth 4.2 Module (old)
ROCKPro64 1x1 Dual Band WiFi 802.11AC / Bluetooth 5.0 Module (new)
| Yes/Yes
|
| No/Yes*
|
| For the "new" ROCKPro64 WIFI module: Verified with Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5). A config file ("firmware file") is needed at `/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt`.
| In 0.7.9 Ayufan linux releases this is deliberately disabled for stability reasons. On Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5), WIFI seems to be stable with the firmware file. On a 5GHz network (802.11AC), it is possible to get about 120Mbps using the "new" ROCKPro64 WIFI module.

| USB OTG

|
| use this script: https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-package/blob/master/root-rockpro64/usr/local/sbin/rockpro64_enable_otg.sh[rockpro64_enable_otg.sh], then configure ip on usb0: ifconfig usb0 169.169.222.222 and run iperf, you should likely see about 200-300MB/s

|
| Stopped working in 4.4.154.1105. Ayufan is looking into it. This is working in Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5). Select the `Analog Output (Built-in Audio Stereo)` option in the audio output device selection window (either use `pavucontrol` or the volume button in the KDE desktop). Despite the slightly misleading name, audio does go through the HDMI port. See here for details: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/no-hdmi-audio-on-rockpro64/25595/2.

| Ventilation does not exist, thus requires manual changes to add venting. Case should be modified to account power adapter not being centered in cut holes. Opening the case once close without modifying it first is nearly impossible without special tools. Graphene heatsink is included and does well for Linux but not Android.

| The PCI Express interface of the RK3399 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=712fa1777207[is limited] to the Gen1 speed. As a result, some installed PCI Express devices may operate with degraded performance, such as M.2 SSDs that support fewer than four PCI Express lanes, installed using an adapter like https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-pci-e-x4-to-m-2-ngff-nvme-ssd-interface-card/[this one].
