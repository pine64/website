== Limitations

=== Older firmware overwrites actively used memory

Some people get system freeze when:

* use SATA disk with ROCKPro64 PCIe card (maybe on newer PCIe card ASM1062 vs ASM1061)
* or do read or write 4GB to the flash (not using PCIe)

If you connect the serial console you will see a Linux kernel oops: (a)synchronous external abort.

Both issues are in fact the same software BUG. There is no hardware problem. Currently, most OS do use uboot with a rockpro blob FW which use memory that Linux kernel is not aware of. 

People are currently fixing this BUG, but it may take some time. In the mean time, you can fix it manually.

The latest u-boot can boot the rockpro64 without any blobs from rockchip.

Install first arm-none-eabi-gcc and aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc compiler, then run the following commands:

Prerequisite packages (Debian/Ubuntu): `device-tree-compiler python gcc-arm-non-eabi flex bison gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc make`

 git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git atf
 make -C atf CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=rk3399 bl31
 git clone https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git u-boot
 cd u-boot/
 git checkout v2020.01-rc5
 make rockpro64-rk3399_defconfig
 BL31=../atf/build/rk3399/release/bl31/bl31.elf make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Which gives you idbloader.img and u-boot.itb. Copy them to the rockpro64, and run the following: (Or put your SD card into your PC)

 sudo dd if=idbloader.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 seek=64
 sudo dd if=u-boot.itb of=/dev/mmcblk0 seek=16384
 sync

=== PCIe Controller Hardware Error Handling Bug

There is an issue with the rk3399 pcie controller that is currently unmitigated:

* link:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/CAMdYzYoTwjKz4EN8PtD5pZfu3+SX+68JL+dfvmCrSnLL=K6Few%40mail.gmail.com/[LKML Original Thread]
* https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/6/320[LKML Additional Information]

The rk3399 pcie controller throws either a synchronous abort or a SError when a pcie device sends an unknown message.

The error type is determined by which cpu cluster handles the message.

=== Virtualization

The PCIe controller on the rk3399 is not behind an IOMMU. This means it is not possible to safely pass through PCIe devices to a virtual machine.
