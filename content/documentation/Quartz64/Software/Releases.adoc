This page contains a list of all available operating systems for the link:/documentation/Quartz64[Quartz64] in alphabetical order, as well as links to other resources.

== Software releases

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to procure a 3.3V UART serial adapter capable of running at 1.5 mbauds, such as https://pine64.com/product/serial-console-woodpecker-edition/[the Woodpecker] if you want to use a Quartz64, as some images' U-Boot may have no video output on this chip.

IMPORTANT: *Note:* The images are provided by the community, not by PINE64. Most community projects currently aim at getting mainline Linux running on the board, not some vendor provided kernel that will never be receiving updates. A mainline-first approach allows for the boards to continue receiving important updates, such as security updates, for years to come, as well as have higher quality code in the kernel as it underwent independent review, but does mean that not all aspects of the hardware work right out of the gate.

=== Armbian

image:/documentation/images/armbian.png[width=100]

*Armbian* is a base operating system platform for single board computers

* Lightweight Debian or Ubuntu based Linux distribution specialized for ARM development boards
* Each system is compiled, assembled and optimized by https://github.com/armbian/build[Armbian Build Tools]
* It has powerful build and software development tools to make custom builds

Download:

NOTE: This image appears to have issues detecting more than 2GB of RAM.It is strongly recommended to use a different distribution.

* https://github.com/armbian/build/releases/[latest, as fresh as possible, upon code change, images]

Notes:

* Support on Armbian forums https://forum.armbian.com/forum/96-upcoming-hardware-wip/

=== DietPi

image:/documentation/images/dietpi.png[width=100]

*DietPi* is a lightweight, yet easy to setup and feature-rich Linux distribution, based on _Debian_. To find out more about DietPi, please visit the https://dietpi.com/docs/[official documentation]. Discuss the Quartz64 build(s) on the https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=17601[PINE64 forum thread].

=== Manjaro ARM

image:/documentation/images/Manjaro-logo.svg[width=100]

*Manjaro ARM* is a user friendly rolling release distribution, based on Arch Linux ARM.

Download:

* Quartz64 Model A: https://github.com/manjaro-arm/quartz64-a-images/releases[Image on GitHub]
* Quartz64 Model B: https://github.com/manjaro-arm/quartz64-b-images/releases[Image on GitHub]

Notes:

Most of the hardware support is already available in the mainline kernel. If some devices doesn't work it is possible to swap to the linux-quartz64 kernel `pacman -S linux-quartz64`.

Following desktop options available:

* Gnome
* KDE Plasma
* Mate
* Sway
* XFCE
as well as minimal image without desktop.

=== NetBSD

*NetBSD* is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It relies upon the UEFI support in Tianocore. Before NetBSD 10 is released, the latest version of NetBSD-current should be used.

Download:

* http://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/[NetBSD daily builds top level] from inside here, navigate to a date, and inside the images/ subdirectory are installable images. Use the one called "NetBSD-<version>-evbarm-aarch64-install.img.gz".

Notes:

* This image can be written to a supported device, such as the eMMC interface, any USB storage device, NVMe, and PCIe AHCI SATA are all supported with builds after 2022-01-15.
* Currently this can not be shared with the EDK2 port, ie, microSD for EDK2 and some other media for NetBSD.

=== pgwipeout's Quartz64 CI

pgwipeout provides continuously rebuilt set of images for Quartz64 devices which includes a Debian installer and a buildroot rescue environment. It is aimed at advanced users who generally know their way around a Linux system, and as a baseline for whether something is working or not. Works on both SD cards and eMMC, uses pgwipeout's patched kernel. Kernels aren't auto-updated on the installed system, so the user manually has to do this by mounting the actual correct boot partition.

Download:

* https://gitlab.com/pgwipeout/quartz64_ci/-/pipelines (Click the three dots on the right, download the merge-job archive.)

Notes:

For Quartz64 Model A, flash _rk3566-quartz64-a.dtb.img.xz_. On Linux, you can for example do this as follows, assuming your target device is _/dev/sdX_:

 sudo -i; xzcat /path/to/rk3566-quartz64-a.dtb.img.xz > /dev/sdX

For Quartz64 Model B, use _rk3566-quartz64-b.dtb.img.xz_ instead.

For line by line instructions to boot Quartz64 CI on a microSD card and use it to install Debian onto an eMMC follow these instructions link:/documentation/Quartz64/Software/Installing_Debian[Installing Debian]

=== Plebian

Plebian stands for *P*INE64 *L*ive D*ebian* and aims to be a fairly vanilla live Debian image for Quartz64 and SOQuartz devices, based on Debian Bookworm.

* https://github.com/Plebian-Linux/quartz64-images/releases[Download Release Images]
* https://github.com/Plebian-Linux/quartz64-images/blob/main/RUNNING.md[Read The Instructions]
* https://plebian.org/[Visit plebian.org to learn more]

To flash, run (replace _/dev/sdX_ with your target block device):

 $ xzcat imagename.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M oflag=dsync status=progress

Some quick notes:

* You will be asked to change your password on first login (for what the default login is, read the instructions)
* Root file system is grown to take up the entire space of your boot device
* NetworkManager is used instead of Debian's interfaces config to be more flexible with what adapters are plugged in and working
* An sshd is started on port 22 with freshly generated keys

=== Tianocore EDK II port by jmcneill

This (as of 2021-12-30) is a work in progress to enable UEFI enabled systems, and is able to bring up SD, eMMC, USB, PCIe with SATA and NVMe, HDMI, thermal sensors, TRNG, as well as general Cortex A-55 features.  Known to work with NetBSD -current, and the ESXi Arm fling version 1.8.

Download:

* https://github.com/jaredmcneill/quartz64_uefi[jmcneill's Quartz64 UEFI Github]

Notes:

* The microSD card image should be written to an microSD card and installed. Currently, using the same card for the operating system as well may be problematic.
