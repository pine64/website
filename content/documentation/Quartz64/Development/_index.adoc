== Current Status

The following sections give an overview over the current status of different parts of the board. Some parts are waiting on a driver to be written or ported, others only need various adjustments.

According to pgwipeout, I/O device performance is within expected ranges now.

=== Working

* eMMC
* SDMMC0 (SD cards)
* GMAC (Gigabit Ethernet)
* USB 2.0
* SATA 2
* SATA 3
* UART
** UART 0 (Pi-bus)
** UART 1 (Bluetooth)
** UART 2 (Pi-bus, debug)
* Video Decode
** VP8
** H.264
* Video Encode
** JPEG (it's pretty bad)
* Battery
* GPU
* Video Output
** HDMI
** DSI
* Audio
** Analog audio works
** SPDIF works
** HDMI works
* SPI &mdash; works, user needs to modify device tree to add devices
* I^2^C &mdash; works, user needs to modify device tree to add devices

=== Partially Working

* PCI-Express Controller &mdash; everything but devices that need cache coherency (e.g. dGPUs) should work
** User:CounterPillow noticed some weirdness with NVMe devices disconnecting during heavy write operations, likely down due to power draw on one of the rails as the same sustained bandwidth could be achieved with a different PCIe device with no issue.
* SDMMC1 (Wi-Fi) &mdash; AP6256 working, BL602 needs some work to make it flash firmware
* https://developer.arm.com/architectures/system-architectures/system-components/arm-generic-interrupt-controller[GIC] &mdash; needs errata published by Rockchip to get upstream to add device-specific workarounds ^link:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/CAMdYzYrQ5f-mv_VmTq_CRf9tR=\j3mwRpKHNLmPFgCF9whsGFRw@mail.gmail.com/[link]^

=== Confirmed Broken

* [.line-through]#USB 3.0 (applies to Model A only) &mdash; only works with very short cables and depends on the device. This is due to a hardware design issue relating to the coupling capacitors needed for SATA, which shares the same lines as USB 3.0.#
** [.line-through]#Hardware design changes have been suggested to engineers, it's in their hands now.#
** Fixed in newer revisions by leaving SATA unpopulated
* RGA &mdash; only works with memory &le; 4 GiB, because Rockchip didn't make the address registers larger. Oopsie.

=== Needs Testing

* E-Paper
* Microphone Input
* CSI &mdash; needs CIF driver
* eDP &mdash; needs PHY driver and controller driver

== TODO

=== ebc-dev Reverse Engineering and Development

The https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/quartz-bsp/linux-next/-/tree/rk356x-ebc-dev[driver for the eInk panel] needs to both be reverse engineered and then rewritten as C. In its current form, it is mostly an assembly dump produced by gcc with debug symbols. See link:/documentation/General/RK3566_EBC_reverse-engineering[RK3566 EBC Reverse-Engineering] for details.

=== Investigate MCU

The RK3566 comes with an integrated RISC-V microcontroller (MCU). It communicates with the A55 host through the Mailbox system driven by the rockchip-mailbox driver. Since this MCU would be quite useful for things such as low power standby mode, investigating how it can be turned on and have firmware flashed to it should greatly enhance the power saving features of the PineNote.

The user liamur https://github.com/liamhays/rk3566-mcu[did some investigation] into the MCU and found that it is disabled by TF-A on suspend, and doesn't reside in a low-power part of the RK3566 anyway. It does however have access to most of the chip and could be used as (for example) a real-time coprocessor.

=== Mainline U-Boot Work

We currently use the "downstream" Rockchip U-Boot, which is based on an old version of U-Boot and contains vendor specific patches that have not undergone the same level of code review as they'd have done had they been submitted upstream.

While the lack of ATF sources means that using mainline U-Boot would still require the use of Rockchip provided binaries for the firmware, even with Rockchip blobs, a more modern version of U-Boot will be much nicer to use.

Mainline U-Boot contains good enough support for the RK3566 SoC used on the Quartz64 as of v2023.07 and have support for Quartz64 and SOQuartz as of v2023.10-rc2. Drivers for https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/1841800/[ethernet GMAC] and https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1817295/[Motorcomm PHY] are supported as of v2024.01-rc1.

==== Things that could be done

This list is non-exhaustive as we don't exactly know how much is missing

* Port a basic VOP2 driver to get a framebuffer from u-boot

==== List of Useful Resources for this Task

* Downstream Rockchip U-Boot repository with Quartz64 specific patches: https://gitlab.com/pgwipeout/u-boot-rockchip/-/tree/quartz64
* Mainline Rockchip custodian U-Boot repository: https://source.denx.de/u-boot/custodians/u-boot-rockchip
* U-Boot Mailing List: https://lists.denx.de/listinfo/u-boot

=== eDP Driver Porting

The eDP PHY driver and controller driver needs to be ported, brought into shape and submitted with proper commit attribution to the Rockchip authors.

User:CounterPillow has experimentally ported stuff, but it's currently not working.

=== Booting

==== Boot Order

The RK3566 boot ROM will search for a valid ID BLOCK in the following order on the support boot media:

* SPI NOR flash
* SPI NAND flash
* eMMC
* SD-Card

If this fails, the boot ROM will initialize the USB0 port and wait for a connection from the Rockchip
flash/boot tools.

==== Bootloader Flashing

As per pgwipeout's https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/quartz-bsp/u-boot/-/commit/12d102b86813378af08b086f3b9c13ed8010754c[commit message]:
