Note: Please expand this section with more cases known to work.

== Model "A"

All enclosures that fit the ROCKPro64 should fit the Quartz64 Model "A", as the I/O has been laid out the same on purpose.

* link:/documentation/Accessories/Cases/Model_A_Acrylic_Open_Enclosure[Model A Acrylic Open Enclosure] - but see the troubleshooting section below.
* link:/documentation/Quartz64/Accessories/Premium_aluminium_case[RockPro64 Premium Aluminium Case]
* link:/documentation/ROCKPro64#3D_printable_ITX_mounting_brackets[ROCKPro64] (Not an enclosure but allows to mount the board in an ATX/ITX case)

== Model "B"

* link:/documentation/Accessories/Cases/Model_B_Acrylic_Open_Enclosure[Model B Acrylic Open Enclosure]
* the ROCK64 aluminium enclosure *does not* work, as the DC input jack is placed differently
