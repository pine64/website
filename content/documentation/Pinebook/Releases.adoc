Installation:

* The https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/arm64/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/README.concatenateable_images[Readme] provides info about concatenating https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/arm64/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/firmware.pinebook.img.gz[firmware.pinebook.img.gz] + https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/arm64/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/partition.img.gz[partition.img.gz] to create a bootable installer image.

Notes:

* Installer offers automatic partitioning and full-disk encryption (LUKS), but only manual partitioning with a single ext4 partition has been confirmed to work.
* Bootloader must be installed separately after installation, before rebooting.
* WiFi driver kernel module must be provided during installation, or a USB network adapter used. (Android USB tethering works, with network driver `rndis_host`).
