The following article contains a selection of common ways to contribute to the community projects.

## Reporting issues

Reporting issues is a great way to contribute (if done correctly). The software projects are using bug trackers to keep track of bugs and to link patches or changes with these bug reports.

See the article [where to report bugs](/documentation/Introduction/Where_to_report_bugs) to find out where you can report bugs.

## Contributing code

By contributing code, for example as documented in the following project pages (alphabetical order):

* elementary: [Get Involved](https://elementary.io/get-involved) and the [ARM project on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/108)
* KDE: see [Get Involved](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved) and [Help:Contribute](https://community.kde.org/Help:Contribute)
* Plasma Mobile: https://plasma-mobile.org/get-source/ (see the "Contributing" section)
