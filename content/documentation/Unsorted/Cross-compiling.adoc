The Pinephone's triple for cross-compiling is `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

== C/++

=== Installing the Toolchain

IMPORTANT: Please add instructions for other distributions to this section if you know them|

First, you'll need to install the gcc cross-compilation toolchain.

==== On Arch Linux

  $ sudo pacman -S aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc

==== On Ubuntu/Debian

  $ sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

==== On Void Linux

  $ sudo xbps-install cross-aarch64-linux-gnu

=== Using the Toolchain

_Note: If you are trying to build an Arch Linux package with `makepkg`, also make sure to `export CARCH=aarch64`._

==== GNU Make

===== Kernel Makefile

For each invocation of `make`, be sure to pass the options `ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-` like this:

  $ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

===== Other

If you are using a handwritten Makefile (not autogenerated by a meta-buildsystem such as meson, automake, etc.) then simply override `CC` and `LD` as you need.

==== automake

  $ ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu

==== meson

See https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html[the official meson documentation] on the topic. In general, the introduction is a good read for any cross-compiling novice.

== Rust

In order to cross-compile Rust applications for the Pinephone, you need to have a gcc cross-compiler installed and the Rust dependencies, usually the std crate, cross compiled for the target system. A more extensive explanation can be found on https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross. This instruction is based on it's description.

=== Installing a GCC Cross-Compiler

The cross-compiler might have a different name depending on the operating system. Further along this instruction the name for the gcc cross-compiler will be used. Replace all occurences of `$gcc_name` with the name on your distribution.

For how to install the gcc cross-compilation toolchain on your distribution, please see link:/documentation/Unsorted/Cross-compiling#Installing The Toolchain[Cross-compiling]

=== Installing Rust Dependencies

The necessary dependencies can easily be installed with rustup:

  $ rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

OR it can be installed with multirust [Is this still accurate???]:

  $ multirust add-target nightly aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

=== Compiling

==== rustc

When using rustc just add the two flags --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu and -C linker=$gcc_name. Under Arch, this would look like:

  $ rustc --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -C linker=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc main.rs

To test it, run the program on your Pinephone

  $ scp main user@ipadress:/home/user/Downloads
  $ ssh user@ipadress /home/user/Downloads/main
  Hello, world|

==== cargo

To cross-compile a project with cargo, open the folder of the project in a terminal. Then create a new folder and a file for cargo.

  $ mkdir .cargo
  $ cat >.cargo/config <<EOF
  > [target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
  > linker = "$gcc_name"
  > EOF

Then you can compile it with

  $ cargo build --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

To test it, copy the file on your Pinephone

  $ scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/main user@ipadress:/home/user/Downloads

Then you can execute it by

  $ ssh user@ipadress ./main -h
  Hello, world|

=== Possible Errors

If you encounter an error saying

  Cross compilation detected. Use PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 to override

just add that variable in front of your command e.g.

  PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 cargo build --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
