== Compiling

=== Build machine

* 64 bit Linux (Manjaro tested)
* At least 16G RAM
* At least 250G free storage, preferably SSD based
* Use a POSIX compliant shell such as bash, not zsh (in Manjaro "chsh -s /bin/bash username")

==== Manjaro packages

The following packages are needed (install with "sudo pacman -S packagename"):-

* make
* gcc
* python-pip
* dtc
* bison
* flex
* cpio
* unzip
* zip

Once this is done run

* pip install pyelftools
** sudo isn't needed

You will also need libncurses.so.5. The easiest way to install this appears to be using an Arch AUR package.

* Enable AUR
* pamac install ncurses5-compat-libs
** don't use sudo
