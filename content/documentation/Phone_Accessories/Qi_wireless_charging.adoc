[WARNING]
==== 
Possible safety hazard: If the wireless charging chip fails for some reason, do not plug the phone in to charge via USB-C. Take the back case off first. It is possible that power gets fed into the chip, causing it to overheat, possibly causing damage to the phone and creating a fire-hazard.

Until the cause of this is determined, it is recommended NOT to use the wireless charging add-on.
