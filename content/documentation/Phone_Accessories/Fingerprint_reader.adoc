Uses the pogo pins to interface a high quality fingerprint sensor, which uses open firmware for it's i2c bridge, and can also be used for gesture navigation thanks to it's ability to detect directional swipes.

IMPORTANT: No PinePhone operating system has added support for the fingerprint reader yet.
