Position of the two-pin header for disabling the optionally installed eMMC module (highlighted in red)

Optionally installed eMMC module can be disabled by placing a jumper onto the two pins on the separate two-pin header, located near one of the mounting holes and two side-mounted buttons. See the picture in this section, in which this two-pin header is highlighted in red.

== Expansion Ports

All GPIO pins, including UART, operate at 3.3V. (See VCCIO5 in the schematics.)

* 2x20 pins "Pi2" GPIO Header
* 2x11 pins "Pi P5+" GPIO Header (with 2nd 10/100Mbps Ethernet pins)
