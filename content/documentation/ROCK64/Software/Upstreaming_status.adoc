|===
| Function 2+| Status | Component | Notes

| Video Output
2+| Linux Mainline
| `rockchipdrm`
| With mpv, you'll need to specify something like `mpv --gpu-context=drm --drm-connector=1.HDMI-A-1` to get it to play back on a VT

| 3D Acceleration
| Linux Mainline
| Upstream Mesa
| `lima`
| Very recent version recommended for the best experience. Has weird glitches on HDMI output in weston.

| Video Decode
| Linux Staging
| Broken/Not in ffmpeg
| `hantro_vpu` and `rockchip_vdec`, using `v4l2-requests`
| https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/49b1-608d4d00-2b-62afdf80@101971638/[Soon to be moved out of staging], ffmpeg patch set https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org/project/ffmpeg/patch/20201209202513.27449-3-jonas@kwiboo.se/[seemingly abandoned], does not work on newer kernels. https://github.com/Kwiboo/FFmpeg/commits/v4l2-request-hwaccel-master-stable[Git branch with commits]

| Audio
2+| Linux Mainline
| `snd_soc_rockchip_*`
| 

| Power Button
2+| Linux Mainline
| `rk805_pwrkey`
| If your PWR switch does nothing unless held, this may need to be loaded manually with `modprobe` or by putting it in `/etc/modules-load.d/`

| Analog Video Output
2+| Needs porting
| `rockchip_drm_tve`
| Definitely needs some cleanup before it'd be ready for mainline, and needs some dt bindings written.
