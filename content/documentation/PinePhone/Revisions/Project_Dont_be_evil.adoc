The Project *Don't be evil* is the phase two of _PINE64's_ smartphone, the link:/documentation/PinePhone[PinePhone] Development Kit. Project Don't be evil is an actual smartphone developer kit for the PINE64 Smartphone dubbed "PinePhone". It is used in the early stages of development as a starting point for affiliated projects.

The PinePhone development has been broken down into three distinct phases:

* First phase - Project Anakin
* Second phase - purpose-built development kit code named "Don't be evil" and introduced at FOSDEM 2019
* Lastly, the third phase which is the PinePhone itself - scheduled to be prototype released in Q3 2019 and BTO batch released with mobile OS parents in Q4 2019 (pending on software development).

Instructions:

* https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Pine_Don%27t_be_evil_devkit_(pine-dontbeevil)[postmarketOS PinePhone "Don't Be Evil" dev kit wiki site]

Notes:

* postmarketOS early alpha test build for microSD boot
* for 8GB microSD cards and above
* Suitable for PinePhone "Don't Be Evil" Dev Kit version 1.1 and version 1.2
* There are two type of LCD panels. For long touch screen cable, please use the build with inverted wording.

=== Sailfish OS

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SailfishOS_logo.png" width="100" >}}

The Sailfish OS image is build on Gitlab CI, the latest image can be installed using our https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailfish-on-dontbeevil/flash-it/master/flash-it.sh[flashing script] written in Bash.

The script downloads the image and bootloader from our CI, extracts everything and burns it onto the SD card.

Instructions:

. Download the flashing script
. Insert a microSD card in your device
. Make the script executable: `chmod +x flash-it.sh`
. Execute it: `./flash-it.sh`
. Follow the instructions. Some commands in the script require root permissions (for example: mounting and flashing the SD card).

Notes:

* The script will format and flash the SD card, make sure that you don't have any important data on the SD card!

== Mali Driver

For the Mali driver see link:/documentation/General/Mali_driver[Mali Driver].

== Errata for ver1.1 and ver1.2 board

. Please DON'T insert micro SIM card to dev kit board micro SIM card slot, the SIM data, VPP, and GND signal have been misplaced. A miciPCIe adapter with sim card holder 9shown as below photo) will be provide to developers to correct this mistake.

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/MiniPCIe_with_sim_slot_adapter.png" width="200" >}}

. The PinePhone dev kit doesn't charge due to VBUS on SOPine module is not connected. Please connect R9688 solder pads with 0 ohm resistor or using thin wire bridge up the solder pads. Location shows as below:

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/PinePhone_VBUS_charging_small.png" width="200" >}}

. The SOPINE's SPI NOR flash storage and the devkit's camera flash (heh) share the same GPIO pins. The flash storage may not be used.

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SOPINE-SPI-Flash.png" width="200" >}}

. On the camera flash GPIO conflict, the new assignment of GPIO PB3 pin for SGM3140 FLASH_EN and GPIP PD7 for FLASH_TRIGOUT. Please note that PD7 is also LCD_ID pin which may not be used.
