== The Project "Anakin" - Phase 1 of PINE64 Smartphone "PinePhone" Development Kit

Project Anakin is a marsh-up kit for the PINE64 Smartphone dubbed "PinePhone". It is used in the early stages of development as a starting point for affiliated projects.

PinePhone development has been broken down into three distinct phases:

* First phase - Project Anakin
* Second phase - purpose-built development kit code named "Don't be evil". It will be introduced at FOSDEM 2019
* Lastly, the third phase which is the PinePhone itself - scheduled to be released in Q3 2019 (pending on software development).

The Anakin kit consists of following components:

* SoPine Module
* SoPine Model A baseboard
* Pine A64 Wifi/BT module
* 16GB eMMC module
* 5 Mega Piixel CMOS Camera Sensor
* 7" Touch Screen LCD Panel
* Playbox Enclosure
* Lithium Ion Battery case (note: battery not included, can accommodate 1-3 pieces of 18650 size Lithium Ion batter. In general, one is good enough)
* Quectel EC20 R2.1 LTE Module (note: The SIM tray design not distinguish polarity well and all reverse slot in)
