The USB-C UART adapter can be connected to the PineTab2 to debug boot issues at the early boot:

* Plug the adapter face-up in the USB-C port furthest away from the power button. If all the lights are lit, you have the wrong port: only the green light should be lit when you first plug it in.
* Plug USB-C cable into the port on the adapter marked "DEBUG" (the other port can be used as a power delivery passthrough so you can charge and debut at the same time)
* Open a terminal window
* Install _minicom_ or _screen_ via your distribution's package manager, if you don't have it installed already
* Connect via minicom using `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000` or via screen using `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 1500000`
** Ubuntu-based distro users may encounter the error, "cannot open /dev/ttyUSB0: No such file or directory".  If this occurs, check the output of `sudo dmesg --follow` and unplug/replug the USB to look for any errors.  If you see an error like, "usb 1-1: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1", then the brltty service is likely conflicting with this device.  Brltty provides access to blind users who use a braille display: if you do not need this service, try disabling it using these commands:
*** `sudo systemctl stop brltty-udev.service`
*** `sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service`
*** `sudo systemctl stop brltty.service`
*** `sudo systemctl mask brltty.service`
