This page contains a list of all available releases and tools for the PineTab2 in alphabetical order. 

== Factory releases

The PineTab2 ships with _Danctnix Arch Linux ARM_. The latest factory image can be found here:

* https://echo.danctnix.org:7269/danctnix-factory-image-20240307.img.xz (2.1 GB)

The original, older factory image can be found here:

* https://echo.danctnix.org:7269/danctnix-factory-image-20230527.img.xz (1.5 GB)

NOTE: The factory image is flashed to a microSD card and it will overwrite the eMMC installation after booting.

== Linux

=== Arch Linux ARM

(Unofficial) Arch Linux ARM maintained by the https://danctnix.org/[DanctNIX] community (GitHub: https://github.com/DanctNIX/danctnix[danctnix], https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded[dreemurrs-embedded]).

==== Notes

* The latest version ships with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers disabled, because these are unstable. The drivers can be manually enabled from the command line:

Run this command to enable Wi-Fi for a single session (until the next time you reboot your PineTab): 

 $ sudo modprobe bes2600

Run the following commands to enable Wi-Fi automatically at every boot:

 $ sudo -i
 > echo bes2600 | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/bes2600.conf
 > exit

Run the following commands to enable Bluetooth for a single session (until the next time you reboot your PineTab) https://www.reddit.com/r/PINE64official/comments/1akjlwu/tutorial_wifi_and_bluetooth_on_pinetab_2/[(source)]:

 $ sudo pacman -S bluez-deprecated-tools
 > sudo -i
 > echo ifname:bt cmd:BT_ON > /dev/bes2600
 > rfkill unblock bluetooth
 > hciattach -s 1500000 /dev/ttyS1 any 1500000 flow nosleep
 > hciconfig hci0 up
 > exit
 > sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

* The original factory image did not ship with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers. If your PineTab is still on an older kernel version (check `uname -a`, it should show 6.6.13 or newer), you can update the kernel using `pacman -Syu` and a supported Wi-Fi dongle, or flash the latest version of the factory image.
* System hangs on reboot/shutdown (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth driver bug, only happens when the driver is enabled)
* https://github.com/ScottFreeCode/Pine64-Arch/tree/master/PKGBUILDS/pine64/alsa-ucm-pinetab2[HP/Speaker switching via Alsa UCM] - _Unsure if this is fixed or not_

=== Buildroot

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation.

An external tree for the PINE64 PineTab2 is developed and maintained by _Danct12_ (same developer behind the PineTab2 port of _Arch Linux ARM_).

==== Download

* The repository and build instructions can be found https://github.com/Danct12/buildroot_pinetab2[here].

=== LuneOS

LuneOS is one of the original multi-tasking OS-es that runs on Linux. Based on HP/Palm's webOS, merged with latest technology stack from LG called webOS OSE (a derivative of what LG uses on their Smart TV's), software such as Qt6, Maliit, PulseAudio, Wayland and makes use of the Yocto build system.

==== Download

Stable: https://github.com/webOS-ports/luneos-releases/releases/

Testing: https://github.com/webOS-ports/luneos-testing/releases/

NOTE: U-Boot is required to boot the images. If you have the factory image installed and updated to the latest version, you can boot Mobian from an SD card without installing U-Boot.

==== Notes
* The development is work in progress, but all hardware that's supported by the kernel should work (WiFi/BT included). Camera's aren't working, similar to all other distros due to lack of drivers.
* In order to connect to the device using SSH/SCP, you simply can connect to the device's IP address on port 5522. 
* Teams can be reached via https://t.me/luneos_dev[Telegram] or http://web.libera.chat/#webos-ports[Libera IRC #webos-ports]

=== Mobian

An unofficial https://www.debian.org[Debian] build for ARM64 running with Phosh. The current version of the base Debian system is Debian Bookworm. See the installation instructions https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/PINE64/PineTab2[here]. If you have questions about Mobian, please ask them in the https://matrix.to/#/#mobian:matrix.org[Mobian Matrix room].

==== Download

* https://images.mobian.org/pinetab2/[Images]

NOTE: U-Boot is required to boot the images. If you have the factory image installed and updated to the latest version, you can boot Mobian from an SD card without installing U-Boot.

==== Notes

* The development is work in progress. Mobian's support for the PineTab2 is maintained by https://salsa.debian.org/julianfairfax[Julian]. The Mobian wiki can be found https://wiki.mobian-project.org/[here].
* In order to connect to the device using SSH/SCP, you need to install SSH on the device. You can do this by executing the following in a shell: "sudo apt-get install ssh", afterwards you can connect via SSH/SCP using the PineTab2's IP address on port 22.
* When installing Mobian with full disk encryption and booting with the keyboard case connected, you will have to touch the screen or press a key to show the decryption screen. This is an https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/osk-sdl/-/issues/148[upstream issue].

=== NixOS

NixOS is an immutable Linux distribution built around the Nix configuration language. The NixOS image for PineTab2 uses some downstream modifications to packages, such as an U-Boot package based on 2023.07-rc4 and a kernel also used by the Arch Linux Arm image.

This image is extremely basic and currently boots to a console. A NixOS configuration can be applied after booting to gain a full graphical system.

==== Download

* https://github.com/nabam/nixos-rockchip/releases

==== Notes

After booting, enable networking (with _wpa_supplicant_, see https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-installation-manual-networking) and download (for example by entering `nix-shell wget` to get access to wget) this flake to the pinetab and place it at /etc/nixos/flake.nix:

* https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pinetab2-nixos/raw/branch/main/flake.nix

Run the following commands:

 $ sudo su
 > cd
 > nixos-rebuild switch
 > nixos-rebuild switch # yes, do it two times
 > reboot

After the first `nixos-rebuild`, you may need to reconnect to the network using `nmtui`.

After rebooting, there will be a new user account.

Note that booting can take a while, and does not show anything on the screen. After about 18 seconds the keyboard backlight turns on, then it's about 30 seconds until the first text appears on the screen, and another 10 seconds before the session manager shows up.

=== postmarketOS

postmarketOS extends https://www.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] to run on smartphones and other mobile devices.

It offers various user interfaces (Phosh, Plasma Mobile, Sxmo, Plasma Desktop, Gnome 3, Kodi, XFCE4 and more). As of writing, this distro is currently in testing and no official releases are available for download. Instead, users will need to create their own image with the distribution's install and development tool `pmbootstrap`.

==== Download
* https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/PINE64_PineTab_2_(pine64-pinetab2)[Pinetab2 Device Page]
* Build the image with https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Pmbootstrap[pmbootstrap] and flash it to an SD.



=== Rhino Linux

Rhino Linux is an Ubuntu-based distribution that uses the rolling-release model by tracking the `devel` branch of repositories. The port is currently maintained by Oren Klopfer (oklopfer).

The bootloader (u-boot) comes pre-flashed in the port. Installation just requires flashing the `.img.xz` to an SD or the eMMC.
