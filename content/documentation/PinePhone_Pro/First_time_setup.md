{{< figure src="/documentation/images/Pinephone_warning.png" title="A protection foil isolates the battery for the shipping." width="320" >}}

When shipped the battery is isolated from the device using a protective plastic tab, which is required to be removed before using the phone. The battery **will not** charge or boot until it is removed and the battery is connected again.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 To remove the sticker after unboxing the phone: Carefully remove the back panel using the notch in the corner of the back cover without overbending it. Then remove the battery. Peel off the clear plastic sticker below it, which isolates the charging contacts and reinsert the battery.

The SIM card has to be placed in the lower slot, while the microSD has to be placed in the upper slot. Devices shipped after the end of July 2022 do only accept a nano-SIM, the SIM is inserted into a carriage released by slightly pulling on the handle in the lower slot (for information regarding devices shipped prior to end of July 2022 see below).

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 The PinePhone Pros shipped prior to the end of July 2022 come with a micro-SIM slot instead of a nano-SIM slot. Do not insert an empty micro-SIM adapter into the phone and do not release the nano-SIM inside the adapter, as it will get stuck on the contact pins. If the nano-SIM got released inside the adapter inside the phone, carefully reinsert the nano-SIM card without moving the adapter. In that case do not pull on the empty adapter as it will get stuck on the contact pins and damage them!
